# 100DaysOfSwiftUI

This repository is for my notes and code for the [100DaysOfSwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) program by @twostraws.

### The Why

After learning the basics of UIKit, I am jumping ship to SwiftUI. The challenge of practicing everyday demands consistency and I am all for it. I have been following Paul's work for a long time now and I trust his guidance in learning this framework. The Hacking With Swift community is a great place to be and learn!

Core skills, Extension skills and Common beginner mistakes discussed on Day 0.
