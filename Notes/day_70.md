### Adding locations to map
- We can create a button that adds whatever location is at the center of the map.
- We can access the coordinates of the center location using the mapRegion.
- Use: `mapRegion.center.latitude` OR longitude
  
### Customising the map markers.
- Use MapAnnotations for that like we saw previously.
- **Apple recommends that anything interactive should have a minimum touch area of or size of 44x44.**
- Therefore, the frame for the markers will have width and height 44.
- Also, always create an example instance whenever you create a new data type.

> It is a good idea to write a equatable function if comparing just one property is enough to compare two instances of that data type.

```swift
static func ==(lhs: Location, rhs: Location) -> Bool {
    lhs.id == rhs.id
}
```

### Selecting and editing map annotations
- So far we have used a boolean to trigger a sheet. This time if we use a optional of type Location, it will trigger the sheet as soon as it is **not nil**.
- Great thing is it will be again set to nil when the sheet is dismissed.
- This kind of optional binding isnâ€™t always possible, where it is possible it makes for much more natural code.

- An initializer is required if a state variable does not havea defualt value. Example,
```swift 
init(location: Location) {
    self.location = location

    _name = State(initialValue: location.name)
    _description = State(initialValue: location.description)
}

// Take note of State(initialValue: )
```

- @escaping means the function is being stashed away for user later on, rather than being called immediately, and itâ€™s needed here because the onSave function will get called only when the user presses Save.

- Cool thing is if you have a function that takes a parameter but returns nothing as a variable, then you can alter variables across views.
- Thus the initalizer becomes,

```swift
init(location: Location, onSave: @escaping (Location) -> Void) {
    self.location = location
    self.onSave = onSave

    _name = State(initialValue: location.name)
    _description = State(initialValue: location.description)
}
```
